## Ingredient substitution for improved recipe health using different clustering algorithms


### Abstract:
Some recipes are very popular due to their simplicity or their final
taste. But sometimes you would wish for a healthier alternative. In
this paper we try to substitute unhealthy with healthier ingredients
by comparing similar recipes and building clusters from the varying
ingredients. We chose this approach because some ingredients are
essential for a recipe and therefore we don't want to replace those,
irrespective of their healthiness. The clustering algorithms we chose
to compare for this approach are LSI, LDA, Word2Vec and FastText.
From these four algorithms FastText provided the best results.
